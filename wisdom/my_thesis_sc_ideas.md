No Particular Order
=====

#### RapMap
* Start from RapMap and touch lightweight read-mapping.

#### Ddfact
* cover quantification and touch salmon model.

#### Alevin
* Jump into Single cell

#### Polyadenylation
* Aim is to look for alternative polaA cite to generate better isoforms and inturn quantification. Goes well with the idea of Career Proposal Aim2.
* Had interesting results from 10x data

#### Genome-Txome Mapping
* Use Puffish index for mapping to Genome v Txome.
* Already have corner cases from Caviar analysis
* Improve Diff expression.

#### Intron Retention
* RNA-velocity type intron retention using the Genome-Txome Mapping and in turn improve Diffusion / clustering / pseudo time analysis.

#### Gene_uncertainty
* Modify Alevin to perform Gene Uncertainty analysis using Bootstapping.

#### Alevin-Scaling
* Scaling Alevin to handle bigger datasets.
* Use New-MST deduping idea.

#### Information Sharing
* use Bayesian model to share the information across cell.

Four Projects are of atmost importance
### Alevin
### UMI -> RECOMB
### debruijn -> ISMB
### Intron (Drop-Seq)
