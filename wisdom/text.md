# c++ 
## learnt while implementing Alevin and shadowing Rob's code
1. Cmake src and lib separately
2. functional approach: following is one snippet
  * (Build + quant)
  * PE / SE
  * 64/32
  * Quasi / SMEM *multithread
3. Validate at every step, specially multi-thread opration. like in multithread environment Do everything in one variable and then save everything to a const variable before further processing.

# frequently used data-structure in our lab (No particular order):
1. Equivalence Class
2. Suffix Array
3. Rand and select
4. de-bruijn graph (colored and compact)
5. Bloom filter (Normal and Quotient)
6. Graphical Models (This is lil more generic)

# Things Rob does different than me:
1. Project Ideas are very well formulated with the tineast detail possible with every corner case.
2. Think like Bayesian !!!!
3. He think on multiple projects parallely while I can concentrate on only one at a time. (idk which is better though)
