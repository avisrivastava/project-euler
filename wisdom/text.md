# c++ 
## learnt while implementing Alevin and shadowing Rob's code
1. Cmake src and lib separately
2. functional approach: following is one snippet
  * (Build + quant)
  * PE / SE
  * 64/32
  * Quasi / SMEM *multithread
3. Validate at every step, specially multi-thread opration. like in multithread environment Do everything in one variable and then save everything to a const variable before further processing.

# frequently used data-structure in our lab (No particular order):
1. Equivalence Class
2. Suffix Array
3. Rand and select
4. de-bruijn graph (colored and compact)
5. Bloom filter (Normal and Quotient)
6. Graphical Models (This is lil more generic)
7. MCMC

# Things Rob do different than me:
1. Project Ideas are very well formulated with the tineast detail possible with every corner case.
2. Think like Bayesian !!!!
3. He think on multiple projects parallely while I can concentrate on only one at a time. (idk which is better though). [UPDATE] Working on multiple projects helps connect the insights from one another.
4. Think about the tineast detail why it could have happen. Imagination is the key!!!
5. Be cautious of pre-mature conclusion, this biases your analysis, towards the already set conclusion (can be wrong). 
6. Avoid analysis heavy parts of the project, disribute instead and concentrate on method. Don't listen to others.
7. Read what you wrote before sending it once again, and check if it really answers the question.
8. Replying right is the key not low turnaround time (Although sometimes fast*er* reply is needed too.)

# Message to myself
1. Be calm when someone condescend/bitch about you because you lose your shit and makes the situation worse.
2. Frequency doesn't match.
3. RoadBlocks are part of the journey, cherish it.
4. Unless you invest in yourself no one will invest in you.
5. Combining two paper is easier and faster.
6. Small talks with random people can sometimes make big impact later-on.

# Confused
1. In current point of time what is right. Publishing many papers with advisor's idea (fast and fruitful but learning is slow) or backing off, taking your time to come up with your own ideas and making them happen (Big learning curve but you learn to make research happen from Zero).
2. The question which bothers me is, can I even do research when Rob is not there? I had to prove to myself that I can, and with Alevin I kinda did it but it has costed me the whole year with almost no paper, was it the right thing to do when others had like 2 or 3? Presently the sadness of not publishing is overwhelming the happiness of making Alevin happen.
